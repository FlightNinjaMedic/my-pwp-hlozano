										The Medical Cannabis Advocate site comes to life with the purpose to educate and raise
										public awareness on the benefits of medical cannabis and how succesful it is in treating
										life changing conditions such as PTSD, HIV/AIDS and epilepsy specifically a condition
										called Dravet Syndrome which is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy (dysfunction of
										the brain). It begins in the first year of life in an otherwise healthy infant. The above
										being only three of twenty qualifying conditons in the New Mexico Medical Cannabis
										program. As a former NAVY corpsman veteran suffering from PTSD, and a current and very
										active user of medical cannabis, I can positively testify to how medical cannabis has
										improved my quality of life.
