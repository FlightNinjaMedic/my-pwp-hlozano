My Personal Webpage Project

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job on outlining your plan for this project. I can see this site expanding and growing in scale. I see plenty of potential here! This PWP could be just the beginning. 

Right now because of the limited scope of PWP, longer content such as a Q &amp; A section might be out of scope. Maybe a small Q &amp; A with some brief text, but this might be more suited to a separate page of it's own. Of course, I'll leave this decision to your consideration at this point, and we'll see what your wireframes look like before making any hard decisions. There is plenty of room here for expansion of your content. For now, since this is very narrow-scope one-page project - you could think of this page as a launchpad for a larger, more feature-rich site down the line. It could also be used alongside a social media awareness campaign too.

This site would be perfect for a blog and/or forum later on. This would require specialized server-side software like WordPress and forum software, and would likely require a total rebuild. So, for now, think about optimizing your content to fit nicely on a simple, one-page site. Or, if you really want an additional challenge (and more work), you can talk to me about possibly making this site a multi-page project.

Excellent work. There are a few coding points I'd like to take a closer look at. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin Milestone 2&alpha;

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed. I see some minor differences between your GitHub repository and what you have deployed.
- Take a look at line 8 in your HTML. The &lt;header&gt; tag belongs inside the &lt;body&gt; - so move that down after line 10.
- It's a good idea to put your paragraph text inside &lt;p&gt; tags. See lines 34, 38, and 43.

Nice wireframes! I have some questions regarding the differences between your mobile layout and your full-screen layout, but what I see here will provide you with a good guide for your development phase of this project. Your content strategy is clear yet succinct. Nice job.

The layout you've created here is very Bootstrap friendly.

On your mobile wireframes, I would suggest making all of the information sections (NMMCP, Dravet Syndrome, Youngest Patient) all the same size, 100% width, and stack on top of each other. My concern is that you might not have enough room for two sections of content to be side-by-side on very small phones like the iPhone 5.

Consider adding a footer if there are any social media accounts that you'd like to link to. Footers can be very valuable "real estate" on a web page, so use this area to your advantage if you can. 

I would consider including the top navigation menu on your mobile layout too. I don't see it in your wireframes. I would also consider putting the page title/headline "Medical Cannabis Advocate Site" up above the image on the mobile layout too. 

I love that you've kept your layouts and content strategy simple. This project should provide you with a great learning experience and a fair amount of challenge, while still being achievable. Nice work. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). There are some minor issues with your HTML, so please take a look at the Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Watch your indentation in your HTML - it's off.
- The `<title>` tag is missing.
- remove the "/" in line 1
