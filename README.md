My Personal Webpage Project

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent job on outlining your plan for this project. I can see this site expanding and growing in scale. I see plenty of potential here! This PWP could be just the beginning. 

Right now because of the limited scope of PWP, longer content such as a Q &amp; A section might be out of scope. Maybe a small Q &amp; A with some brief text, but this might be more suited to a separate page of it's own. Of course, I'll leave this decision to your consideration at this point, and we'll see what your wireframes look like before making any hard decisions. There is plenty of room here for expansion of your content. For now, since this is very narrow-scope one-page project - you could think of this page as a launchpad for a larger, more feature-rich site down the line. It could also be used alongside a social media awareness campaign too.

This site would be perfect for a blog and/or forum later on. This would require specialized server-side software like WordPress and forum software, and would likely require a total rebuild. So, for now, think about optimizing your content to fit nicely on a simple, one-page site. Or, if you really want an additional challenge (and more work), you can talk to me about possibly making this site a multi-page project.

Excellent work. There are a few coding points I'd like to take a closer look at. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin Milestone 2&alpha;

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed. I see some minor differences between your GitHub repository and what you have deployed.
- Take a look at line 8 in your HTML. The &lt;header&gt; tag belongs inside the &lt;body&gt; - so move that down after line 10.
- It's a good idea to put your paragraph text inside &lt;p&gt; tags. See lines 34, 38, and 43.
